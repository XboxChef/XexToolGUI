    Microsoft ResX Schema

    Version 2.0

    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes
    associated with the data types.

    Example:

    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>

    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple
    name/value pairs.

    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture.
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the
    mimetype set.

    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:

    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can
    read any of the formats listed below.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>XexTool - xorloser

This tool is for research purposes only.
It must not be used for commercial/illegal/pirate uses.

THIS WILL NOT MAGICALLY ALLOW YOU PLAY COPIED GAMES.

:: Overview

This is a tool to extract information on an xex file. It will print out
xex information to the console, alter xex attributes, extract executable code
and other basefiles and create idc scripts files to help with disassembling
the extracted executable code.

Note: Any altered or created retail xex files will not be correctly signed.

:: Install

If you wish to run xextool from anywhere, copy the xextool.exe file to
a location in your path that is used for exe files. If you are not sure
you can check the %PATH% environment variable (type "echo %PATH%" from
the command line) or just copy it into your windows directory.

If you use the "Create IDC" feature of xex tool then you need to copy
x360_imports.idc into your "IDA\idc" directory so that it will be found
by any IDC script that you run.

:: Xex Format Basics

An xex file consists of a basefile that the xex is built around and headers
which contain various attributes to be used with the basefile.

Usually the basefile is an executable file, however it can also be data file,
as seen with ximedic.xex from the xbox360 flash. When the basefile is an
executable file it is either an exe or dll, however it is not stored in its
normal exe or dll format but instead as a binary file.

Some of the xex header attributes are required, and others are optional. Some
of these attributes are things such as the regions the xex is made for and the
media the xex is allowed to boot from.

The basefile can be optionally encrypted using aes encryption. All contents
of the basefile are hashed and then rsa signed. Microsoft is the only one with
access to the private key required to sign xexs in order to allow them to boot
on a retail xbox360. A different key is used to sign xex files in order to
allow them to boot on a development xbox360 (aka devkit).

:: Usage Examples

* Print basic info about an xex file to console:
xextool default.xex

* Print extended info about an xex file to console:
xextool -l default.xex

* Extract the executable basefile from default.xex into default.exe:
xextool -b default.exe default.xex

* Extract the executable file and create an idc script file from default.xex:
xextool -b default.exe -i default.idc default.xex

* Convert a retail xex into a development xex:
xextool -m d default.xex

* Convert a retail xex into a seperate development xex:
xextool -m d -o devkit.xex retail.xex

* Remove all region and media limits from an xex:
xextool -r mr default.xex

* Remove all limits and convert a retail xex into a devkit xex:
xextool -r a -m d default.xex

* Convert an xex into an unencrypted binary format:
xextool -e u -c b -o default-binary.xex default.xex

* Convert unencrypted binary xex back into an encrypted compressed xex:
xextool -e e -c c -o default.xex default-binary.xex

:: Specifics

This tool enables you to do many things with an xex file if you understand
how to do so. Some usage examples are given above, but here is some more
detailed information on a few specific cases.


How to make a retail xexs work on a development xbox360

This is quite easy with this tool, just do the following:
xextool -r a -m d default.xex

Not only will the xex work on a devkit, it will also now work from any media
and run region independently.


How to patch an xex file with an xexp patch file.

Updates to games and system files are provided over xbox live in the form of
patch files. These updates are stored inside package files in the Cache folder
on you hard drive. A system update usually has "SU" as part of the filename,
and a title update (game update) usually has a "TU" as part of the filename.

Note: As of around November 2010 it seems that games are storing their updates
on the internal hdd in the folder "Content\0000000000000000\xxxxxxxx\000B0000\".

A patch file will only work when used with an untouched version of the original
xex file it was created for. When you have the original xex file and the patch
file you want to use with it, do the following to create the updated xex:
xextool -u -p patch.xexp -o output.xex input.xex

Note: A retail xex requires a retail patch file, a devkit xex requires a devkit
patch file. If an xex has been converted from a retail to a devkit xex, you need
to use the retail patch file with the original retail xex, then convert the
resultant xex file into a devkit xex file.


How to reverse engineer and alter the code in an xex file.

Note: While the following still works, it has been superceeded by the separate
Xex IDA Loader which will load the xex file directly into IDA.

First extract the executable base file and idc script file as follows:
xextool -b default.exe -i default.idc default.xex

Xextool will tell you how to load the file into ida. If you don't have ida,
then load it into the disassembler you are using with the same parameters.
An example of the load info xextool gives you is as follows:

Load basefile into IDA with the following details
DO NOT load as a PE or EXE file as the format is not valid
File Type:       Binary file
Processor Type:  PowerPC: ppc
Load Address:    0x92000000
Entry Point:     0x9201DD38

Note: even though this file seems to be a normal exe or dll file it is not!
You MUST load this file as a binary file, not a pe, exe or dll.

Once the file has been loaded into ida, run the idc script file. It will
expect the "x360_imports.idc" file included with xextool to be in your
"ida/idc" directory.

Once you have found any areas you want to change or patch, make these
changes to the exe basefile you extracted above (default.exe).

Now you need to insert the basefile (default.exe) back into your xex file.
So do the following to get a fully decrypted and decompressed xex:
xextool -e u -c b -o default-hack.xex default.xex

Now open default-hack.xex in a hex editor and find where the basefile starts.
You can search for the "MZ" present in the exe header to find 
(Often its around the 0x2000 byte offset mark.)
Now copy the contents of default.exe into default-hack.xex over the top of
the basefile that is inside default.xex. It should exactly fill the rest of
the default-hack.xex file from where you start inserting default.exe.
Now do:
xextool -o default-done.xex default-hack

The default-done.xex file will now be resigned and ready to use, unless its
retail in which case it won't get resigned correctly. When creating the
default-done.xex file you can also specify encryption and compression options
for the output file if you wish.</value>
